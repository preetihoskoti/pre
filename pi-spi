Hello,

I am trying communication between raspberry pi 3 and pic 18F series micro controller through spi, the send and receive data through spi in 18F controller is working perfect s the data is displayed on LCD, but however the spi communication in raspberry pi is not working, the code is printing only 0 values not matter what data is sent only 0 value is executed.
I tried the following program:

import spidev
import time 

spi = spidev.SpiDev()
spi.open(0,1)
counter = 0

while True:
       try:
           print ''writing data''
           data = [104, 103, 102, 108, 111]
          print ">>>" + str(spi.xfer2(data))
          time.sleep(1)
          counter += 1
          if counter > 4 
             break
          time.sleep(1)
     except(keyboardInterrupt, systemExit):
          spi.close()
          raise:
spi.close()
print "done"


Output:
writing data
>>>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
writing data
>>>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
writing data
>>>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
writing data
>>>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
writing data
>>>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
done

Whatever program I run I am getting only 0 values and not the data what i send. kindly please help.
